          your consultation request; information you’ve entered or uploaded to
          profiles and medical records; information created during earlier

          provider, must comply with the privacy legislation and medical
          record-keeping obligations to which they are subject. Authorized
          Physicians may create Information such as prescriptions, sick notes
          and other notes about your interaction with them through the Rocky
          Health Platform. They may export or print copies of your Information
          that they collect. Authorized Physicians may, but are not required to
          email or text your emergency contact if they believe that you are
          dealing with a medical emergency during a consultation. You are
          responsible for advising your emergency contact that you are providing
          their name and contact information to Rocky Health and Authorized
          Physicians, and for obtaining any necessary consent from them for the
          provision and use of their information in connection with the Rocky
