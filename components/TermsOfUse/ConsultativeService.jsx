        In some cases, a Rocky Health or affiliated health care provider may use
        the Services to provide advice or treatment to you. A health care
        provider consulting with you through the Services may not have the
        benefit of information that would be obtained by examining you in person
        and observing your physical condition, in each instance. Therefore, the
        health care provider may not be aware of facts or information that may
        affect his or her opinion regarding a potential diagnosis or treatment
        recommendation. To reduce the risk to you of this limitation, Rocky
        strongly encourages you to provide all relevant information and discuss
        any and all diagnosis and treatment options with a health care provider.
        Moreover, a health care provider utilizing Rocky may be limited by
        provincial law in prescribing certain medications to you without first
        conducting an in-person physical examination.

        By deciding to engage the Services, you acknowledge and agree that you
        are aware of these limitations and agree to assume the risk of these
        limitations. Furthermore, you agree and accept that: (i) any diagnosis
        you may receive is limited and, in some cases, provisional; (ii) the
        health care services are not intended, in all cases, to replace a full
        medical evaluation or an in-person visit with a health care provider;
        (iii) a health care provider acting through the Services may not have
        important information that is usually obtained through a “hands-on”
        physical examination; and (iv) the absence of a physical examination may
        affect the health care provider’s ability to diagnose any potential
        condition, disease or injury.
