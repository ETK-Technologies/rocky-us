        Although certain parts of the Sites are accessible by any individual,

        Services. The Services are available only to users who have registered
        with Rocky and to other persons affiliated with Rocky who have been
        granted accounts with usernames and passwords (“ <b> Secure Users </b>
        ”). If you are a Secure User, you agree to provide information that is
        accurate, complete and correct, and to accurately maintain and update
        any information about yourself that you have provided to Rocky. If you
        do not maintain such information, or Rocky has reasonable grounds to
        suspect as much, Rocky has the right to suspend or terminate your
        account and your use of the Services. You also agree to immediately
        notify Rocky of any unauthorized use of your username, password or any
        other breach of security that you become aware of involving or relating
        to the Services by emailing Rocky contact@myrocky.com . Rocky may take
        any and all actions it deems necessary or reasonable to maintain the
        security of the Sites, Services and your Secure User account.{" "}

        maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You are responsible
        for changing your password promptly if you think it has been
