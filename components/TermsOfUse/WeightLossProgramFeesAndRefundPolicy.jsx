          Non-Refundable Monthly Fee: The monthly program fee of $60 is
          non-refundable once it has renewed. To avoid unwanted charges, you
          must cancel or pause your treatment prior to the renewal date.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advance Medication Refills: If you request medication refills in
          advance to cover multiple months, the monthly program fee will be
          charged upfront. For example, if you request a three-month supply of
          medication, you will be charged $180, at the time of the request.
