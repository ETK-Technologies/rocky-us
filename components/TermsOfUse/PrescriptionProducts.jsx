        Certain products available through the Platform require a valid
        prescription by a licensed healthcare provider. You will not be able to
        obtain a prescription product unless you have completed a consultation
        with one of the Rocky Health Care Providers, the Provider has determined
        the prescription product is appropriate for you and the Provider has
        written a prescription.

      <p className="text-[16px] md:text-[18px] leading-[160%] font-[400] text-[#000000D9] mb-6">
        If a Provider determines a prescription product is appropriate for you
        and writes a prescription, you will receive information about your
        options for filling the prescription. Certain prescriptions can be
        filled through the Rocky Health Pharmacy by using the Platform (or you
        may fill the prescription at any pharmacy of your choice as prompted
        during your use of the Service).

      <p className="text-[16px] md:text-[18px] leading-[160%] font-[400] text-[#000000D9] mb-6">
        If you complete a consultation with a Provider and fill a prescription
        through one of Rocky Health Pharmacies, the prescription product is
        shipped to you by the Rocky Health Pharmacy and the costs associated
        with the prescription are included in the total charged to you by the
        Service as described in the “Subscription Products” section above. If
        you fill a prescription with a pharmacy other than Rocky Health
        Pharmacy, the Service will send the prescription to your selected
        pharmacy, but you will be responsible for picking up or otherwise
        obtaining the prescription product and paying the pharmacy directly for
        the cost of the prescription product.
