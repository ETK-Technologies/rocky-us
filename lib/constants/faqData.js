          answer:
            "Sildenafil is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It helps stimulate the body's normal response to increase blood flow to the penis. Sildenafil is also FDA approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, where it relaxes the blood vessels that are located in the chest near the lungs and heart. This ultimately reduces the workload of the heart by increasing the supply of blood to the lungs.",

          question: "How does Sildenafil work?",
          answer:
            "Sildenafil belongs to a group of medications called phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. This class of medication ultimately increases blood flow to the penis by preventing an enzyme called phosphodiesterase type-5 from working too quickly. By controlling the enzyme, Sildenafil helps men who have difficulty getting or staying erect, making it the go to drug for erectile dysfunction.",

          question: "How long does Sildenafil last?",
          answer:
            "Typically, the amount of Sildenafil in the bloodstream correlates to how long the effects can last. With that being said, Sildenafil’s effect is strongest 2-4 hours after it’s taken, and could last up to 8-12 hours. Please seek medical attention if you feel like you are experiencing a longer than expected erection that lasts more than 4 hours (priapism).",

          question: "How long does it take for Sildenafil to take effect?",
          answer:
            "Sildenafil usually begins to work for erectile dysfunction within 30 minutes of taking it on an empty stomach. Taking the medication on an empty stomach is recommended due to the effect food can have on the absorption of Sildenafil. It then continues to work for up to 4 hours, with its peak effect being 1 hour after it’s taken. How long the medication lasts may differ depending on the individual. Keep in mind that Sildenafil makes it easier to get and maintain an erection, but will only work when an individual is sexually aroused.",

A starting dose of 25mg is usually prescribed if you have not previously used this medication or if you are taking other medications, which may cause potential side effects.

If it does not work for you the first time you take it, don’t be discouraged.

If taken as needed before sexual activity, with a typical starting dose of 10mg or 20 mg, a higher dose is needed than in the once daily regimen (5mg). Taking Tadalafil once daily will allow the medication to build up in your system, making it up to 1.6-times the daily dose. This means 5mg daily can have the same effect as taking 8mg.
