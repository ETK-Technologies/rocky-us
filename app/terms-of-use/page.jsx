              Rocky reserves the right to charge a $45.00 CAD cancellation fee
              (hereinafter referred to as the "WL cancellation fee") for all
              weight loss services and orders. This fee will be automatically
              billed after seven (7) days if the consultation form or ID has not
              been submitted or if consent remains pending. However, if consent
              for treatment is rejected, a full refund will be issued. The full
              price of the medical consultation ($99) will be charged once
              completed, regardless of whether a prescription is issued.

                Non-Refundable Monthly Fee: The monthly program fee of $40 is

                you must cancel or pause your treatment prior to the renewal
